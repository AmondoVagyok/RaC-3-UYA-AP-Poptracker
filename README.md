# Ratchet and Clank 3 AP PopTracker

This is an auto item tracker for [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/releases) to use with the [Ratchet and Clank 3 Archipelago Mod](https://github.com/Taoshix/Archipelago-RaC3/).

## Installation

Just download the lastest build and put in your packs folder (zipped or unzipped work either way).

The packs folder can be under `USER/Documents/PopTracker/packs`, `USER/PopTracker/packs` or `APP/packs`, where `USER` stands for your user directory and `APP` for the PopTracker installation directory.

## Future Updates

This is still pretty early on, and various elements such as logic, yaml settings, and possibly more locations will be added over time (and hopefully sooner rather than later!)
